# Responsive Block Controls

This plugin adds enhanced responsive controls to the block editor.

Intrinsic design is a core principle of WordPress block themes, but it doesn’t cover every use case. With this plugin, you gain additional control over elements that still require media queries — helping you fine-tune your designs across different screen sizes.
